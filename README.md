This README file provides information about the Stock Price Prediction project.

## Features:

Fetches historical stock price data from a financial data API (replace with actual API).
Trains a machine learning model to predict future closing prices based on past data.
Predicts the closing price for a specified future date.

## Important Note:

Stock price prediction is a complex task with inherent uncertainties. This script provides a basic example for educational purposes and should not be used for making investment decisions.

## Installation:

Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/<username>/stock-price-prediction.git (replace <username> with your GitHub username).
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory using cd stock-price-prediction.
Install the required Python libraries using pip install pandas numpy sklearn yfinance (yfinance might be replaced depending on the chosen financial data API).

## Usage:

Run the script using python stock_price_prediction.py.
You will be prompted to enter the stock ticker symbol.
Optionally, you can specify the time frame for historical data retrieval (default is one year).
The script will download historical data, train a model, and predict the closing price for the next day (or a custom future date).
